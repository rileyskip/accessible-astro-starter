## Project Overview

Course Hub was built as cross-functional course management and registration system for lifelong learning programs. The platform streamlines the course administration and management, course discovery  and registration process across multiple departments and professional development programs.

## Design Evolution

### **Phase 1: Initial Branding and Tools**

The initial design was a product of both Adobe XD and Figma. The first iterations featured a card-based layout optimized for mobile devices, making course information easily digestible on smaller screens.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 my-8">
  <Lightbox
    src="/projects/initial-branding.png"
    alt="Mobile course card layout - Before design"
    caption="Initial mobile-first card design showing course information in an easily digestible format for smaller screens."
    width={500}
    height={700}
    class="h-[400px] w-full rounded-lg object-contain bg-white"
  />
</div>

The initial design phase included:
- **Consistent Branding** through color and styling.
- **First card layout iteration** for course details.
- **Expandable sections** for admins to edit course details. 
- **Sortable columns** for easy course comparison
- **Duel Navigation Menus** based on unauthenticated and Admin view.
- **Inline actions** for quick registration or viewing details
- **Multi-field search** with filters for program, instructor, and location



### **Phase 2: Prototype Evolution**
 The prototyping phase was created on a local host using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Javascript. The purpose was for the development team and stakeholders to interact with each functionality of the application, and to evaluate improvements for the design during the development process. 



<div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 md:grid-cols-2 my-8">
  <div class="space-y-4">
    <Lightbox
      src="/projects/initial-prototype.png"
      alt="User view prototype showing improved course detail layout"
      caption="User View prototype with enhanced course detail layout, updated menu and navigation, and improved filtering style based on real data testing."
      width={1200}
      height={200}
      class="w-full"
    />
    <div>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">User View </h3>
      <p class="text-muted">During the prototyping, the course detail layout had been improved for easier to follow reading while in large scale. This was also due to new data, that provided more insight in how the layout fit in real time. Other imporovements were an updated menu and navigation, and filtering style. </p>

  <div class="space-y-4">
    <Lightbox
      src="/projects/initial-admin.png"
      alt="Admin view with navigation menu and action controls"
      caption="Admin View prototype featuring dedicated navigation menu, Actions column for course editing, and multi-select modal for batch editing."

    <div>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Admin View</h3>
      <p class="text-muted">We knew the admin view needed to have a different visual appeal to seperate from user needs. The admin view has a different navigation menu for amdin controls, and has an extra column for Actions to edit or multi-select courses for editing course details. The modal appears when multiple courses are selected for editing. </p>

    <div>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Admin Navigation Menu</h3>
      <p class="text-muted">The Admin Navigation menu features the course listing page gto voew and edit course details, add banners, view and add admin users, manage courses by term, and logout. </p>
    </div>

#### Many Rounds of Polling: Admin Course Edit

We tested many componenets of the app during the prototyping phase using Figma. The Admin course editing went through multiple iterations of designs and polling.

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Override Mode</h3>
     
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



### **Phase 3: A/B Testing, Design Improvements, and User Flow Figma Protoyping**
With the use of our functioning prototpe, we A/B tested our application, looked for ways to improve user flow, card layout, and overall usability. 
Having attended Figcon 2024, I proposed using Dev Mode version of Figma, to enhance our abilities in the software and communicate within the team. 

Once Dev Mode was activated, we rebranded our checkout flows in Figma, created a poll, and found the best solution for user navigation. We applied our new designs and began developing in the Next.js framework.
