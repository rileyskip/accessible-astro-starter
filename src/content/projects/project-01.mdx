## Project Overview

I designed and prototyped a comprehensive cruise booking application that provides users with an intuitive and engaging way to explore and book cruise vacations. The prototype focuses on creating a seamless user experience from initial browsing to final booking confirmation, with special attention to accessibility and mobile responsiveness.

## Design Process

The project began with extensive user research to understand the pain points in current cruise booking experiences. I conducted interviews with frequent travelers and analyzed competitor platforms to identify opportunities for improvement. The key insights led to a design that prioritizes:

- **Visual Discovery**: Large, high-quality images of destinations and ships
- **Simplified Navigation**: Intuitive filtering and search capabilities
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear breakdown of costs and available packages
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive layout optimized for mobile booking
