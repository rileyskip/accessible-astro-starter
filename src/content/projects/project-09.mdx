**Role:** Freelance Web Designer and Developer  

## Brand Identity Development

Working closely with the client, I developed a comprehensive brand identity that reflected the professionalism and reliability of their inspection services. The brand identity included:

- **Color Scheme**: Professional palette combining trust-building blues with approachable neutrals
- **Logo Design**: Clean, modern logo incorporating the "eclipse" concept as a symbol of exponential growth
- **Typography**: Font selection balancing professionalism with accessibility and readability
- **Visual Language**: Consistent design elements 


## Website Design & Architecture

The website was designed to serve multiple audiences—homebuyers, real estate agents, and property owners—with clear navigation and organized information architecture:

### Key Sections

- **Services Overview**: Clear presentation of inspection services including residential, multi-dwelling, commercial, pool, and termite inspections
- **Pricing Transparency**: Straightforward pricing structure by square footage
- **Scheduling System**: Flexible booking options highlighting same-day and next-day availability
- **Educational Content**: "What to Expect" section outlining the inspection process
- **About Section**: Personal introduction to build trust with potential clients
- **Testimonials**: Social proof from satisfied customers
- **Contact Information**: Multiple contact methods for easy client communication

## Technical Implementation

### CMS Development

The website was built using a content management system with the following considerations:

- **Client Maintainability**: Intuitive interface allowing the client to update content, pricing, and testimonials without technical knowledge
- **Handoff Ready**: Comprehensive training and documentation for seamless client takeover
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring excellent experience across all devices
- **Google Analytics Integration**: Tracking visitor behavior and conversion metrics
- **Local SEO**: Geographic targeting for South Jersey, Northern Delaware, and Southeastern PA markets
