## Project Overview

Dreamvision is a creative design project that explores the intersection of visual storytelling and interactive design. This is a personal project to engage users through compelling narratives and intuitive interactions. This prototype was the result of attending FigmaCon 2024 and learning new design trends and features.

## Design Philosophy

Dreamvision was born from the concept that digital experiences should be more than functional—they should be memorable and emotionally engaging. The project explores how design can create meaningful connections with users through:

- **Visual Storytelling**: Narrative-driven design that guides users through compelling experiences
- **Interactive Elements**: Engaging micro-interactions that enhance user engagement
- **Emotional Design**: Creating experiences that resonate on an emotional level
- **Innovative Layouts**: Breaking traditional design patterns with personalized mid century iconography





## Technical Implementation

The Dreamvision platform was designed using UX/UI methodologies:

- **Figma Free Version**: Design systema with interactive prototyping
- **Information Architecture**: Intuitive content organization and navigation
- **Interactive Prototyping**: Prototyping with conditional logic
- **Design System**: A design system was created to ensure consistency across the prototype
- **AI Integration**: Utilizing AI plugins to enhance the design process for faster layout creation, from information gathered from FigmaCon 2024.

## Future Possibilities

This project serves as a foundation for exploring new frontiers in Figma. 

- **AI Integration**: Utizing curerent Figma features and plugins top enhance the product on the development side. 
- **Figma Dev Mode**: Experiencing the power of Figma Dev Mode to enhance the prototyping power and create stronger libraries and components.
