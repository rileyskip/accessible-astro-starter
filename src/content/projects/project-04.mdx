## Development Process

This role required deep understanding of both Drupal's content management capabilities and the specific needs of educational institutions. My development approach included:

- **Custom Theming**: Codeveloping a Drupal subtheme based on University branding using HTML, Bootstrap 4 & 5, CSS, Twig, JavaScript, and PHP. 
- **Content Strategy**: Structured content types based on departmental needs and usage. 
- **Wireframing and UX Design**: Building wireframes, new web designs, and user flows to improve experience and interactions in collaboration with departmental admins.
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards implemented through custom theming, twig templating, and custom error handling. 
- **Accessibility Management**: Monthly accessibility reporting, bug fixes, and resolutions through new coding practices, module updates, and editor awareness of ADA guidelines.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for students accessing organization sites on various devices.
- **Module Maintenence**: Routine module updates, bug and error resolution, and module conflict resolution.

## Key Features


- **Content Architecture**: Custom content types based on departmental needs.
- **User Roles & Permissions**: Granular access control for different user types and editor roles.
- **Views & Displays**: Dynamic content presentation with contextual filtering.
- **Form Management**: Custom webforms, email handling, and submission notifications.
- **Media Management**: Optimized image and document handling.

### Accessibility & Compliance

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Standards**: Full compliance with accessibility guidelines.
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard accessibility.
- **Color Contrast**: High contrast ratios for better readability.
- **Alt Text**: Comprehensive image descriptions for all media.
